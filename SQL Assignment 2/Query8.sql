-- Fields to Retrieve:

-- PRODUCT_ID
-- FACILITY_ID
-- QOH (Quantity on Hand)
-- ATP (Available to Promise)

select p.product_id,
       ii.facility_id,
       ii.quantity_on_hand_total,
       ii.available_to_promise_total,
       (ii.quantity_on_hand_total - ii.available_to_promise_total) as Difference
from product p
